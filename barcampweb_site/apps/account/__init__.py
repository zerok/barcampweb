"""
This module offers basically 2 ways for a person to log in:

1. By username and password

2. By username alone

The first offers the usual functionalities like changing your password, 
using a gravatar etc. while the latter should make it easy for people to
add themselves to the list of participants and propose talks without having
to remember another password.

People without a real account are treated as anonymous users.
